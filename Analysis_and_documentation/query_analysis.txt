HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS LAB - PART 2: QUERY PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
=============================================================

QUESTION 1: Monthly Encounters by Specialty
============================================

SQL Query:
----------
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(e.encounter_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    s.specialty_name,
    e.encounter_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_encounters,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.patient_id) AS unique_patients
FROM encounters e
JOIN providers p ON e.provider_id = p.provider_id
JOIN specialties s ON p.specialty_id = s.specialty_id
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(e.encounter_date, '%Y-%m'), s.specialty_name, e.encounter_type
ORDER BY month, s.specialty_name, e.encounter_type;

Schema Analysis:
---------------
Tables joined: encounters, providers, specialties
Number of joins: 2
Join chain: encounters → providers → specialties
Aggregation: GROUP BY with COUNT() and COUNT(DISTINCT)

Performance:
-----------
Execution time: ~1.2 seconds (estimated)
Estimated rows scanned: 
- encounters table: full scan (~10,000+ rows)
- providers table: lookup per encounter (~1,000 rows)  
- specialties table: lookup per provider (~10 rows)
Total rows processed: ~20,000+

Bottleneck Identified:
---------------------
1. Multiple JOIN chain creates cartesian product risk
2. GROUP BY on computed DATE_FORMAT() prevents index usage
3. COUNT(DISTINCT) requires sorting/hashing for uniqueness
4. No index on encounter_date for efficient date filtering
5. Full table scan on encounters table

Root Cause: Complex aggregation with multi-table joins and computed grouping columns


QUESTION 2: Top Diagnosis-Procedure Pairs
==========================================

SQL Query:
----------
SELECT 
    d.icd10_code,
    d.icd10_description,
    pr.cpt_code,
    pr.cpt_description,
    COUNT(*) AS encounter_count
FROM encounter_diagnoses ed
JOIN diagnoses d ON ed.diagnosis_id = d.diagnosis_id
JOIN encounters e ON ed.encounter_id = e.encounter_id
JOIN encounter_procedures ep ON e.encounter_id = ep.encounter_id
JOIN procedures pr ON ep.procedure_id = pr.procedure_id
GROUP BY d.icd10_code, d.icd10_description, pr.cpt_code, pr.cpt_description
ORDER BY encounter_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

Schema Analysis:
---------------
Tables joined: encounter_diagnoses, diagnoses, encounters, encounter_procedures, procedures
Number of joins: 4
Join pattern: Two junction tables connected through encounters table
Many-to-many relationships: diagnoses ↔ encounters ↔ procedures

Performance:
-----------
Execution time: ~2.8 seconds (estimated)
Estimated rows scanned:
- encounter_diagnoses: ~15,000 rows
- encounter_procedures: ~12,000 rows  
- encounters: ~10,000 rows
- diagnoses: ~500 rows
- procedures: ~300 rows
Total rows processed: ~75,000+ (due to row explosion)

Bottleneck Identified:
---------------------
1. ROW EXPLOSION: Junction tables create M×N combinations
2. Complex 4-table join chain with no optimal join order
3. Bridge table pattern requires scanning multiple junction tables
4. No composite indexes on junction tables for efficient joins
5. Large intermediate result set before GROUP BY

Root Cause: Many-to-many relationships causing exponential row multiplication


QUESTION 3: 30-Day Readmission Rate  
===================================

SQL Query:
----------
WITH inpatient_discharges AS (
    SELECT 
        e.encounter_id,
        e.patient_id,
        e.discharge_date,
        p.specialty_id,
        s.specialty_name
    FROM encounters e
    JOIN providers p ON e.provider_id = p.provider_id  
    JOIN specialties s ON p.specialty_id = s.specialty_id
    WHERE e.encounter_type = 'Inpatient' 
    AND e.discharge_date IS NOT NULL
),
readmissions AS (
    SELECT 
        id.encounter_id AS initial_encounter,
        id.specialty_id,
        id.specialty_name,
        COUNT(e2.encounter_id) AS readmission_count
    FROM inpatient_discharges id
    LEFT JOIN encounters e2 ON id.patient_id = e2.patient_id
        AND e2.encounter_date > id.discharge_date
        AND e2.encounter_date <= DATE_ADD(id.discharge_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
        AND e2.encounter_type IN ('Inpatient', 'ER')
    GROUP BY id.encounter_id, id.specialty_id, id.specialty_name
)
SELECT specialty_name, total_discharges, total_readmissions, readmission_rate_percent
FROM specialty_readmission_rates
ORDER BY readmission_rate_percent DESC;

Schema Analysis:
---------------
Tables joined: encounters (self-joined), providers, specialties
Number of joins: 3 (including self-join)
Complex pattern: Self-join with date range conditions
Multiple CTEs with aggregation

Performance:
-----------
Execution time: ~3.5 seconds (estimated)  
Estimated rows scanned:
- encounters table: scanned twice (~20,000 total)
- Date range comparisons: N×M combinations for each patient
- Provider/specialty lookups: additional overhead
Total operations: ~50,000+ comparisons

Bottleneck Identified:
---------------------
1. SELF-JOIN on encounters table - most expensive operation
2. Date range calculations (DATE_ADD) prevent index usage
3. For each inpatient encounter, scan ALL future encounters for same patient
4. No index on (patient_id, encounter_date) for efficient range queries
5. Complex date arithmetic in WHERE clause
6. Multiple CTE materialization overhead

Root Cause: Self-joins on large tables with complex temporal conditions


QUESTION 4: Revenue by Specialty & Month
========================================

SQL Query:
----------
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(e.encounter_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    s.specialty_name,
    SUM(b.claim_amount) AS total_claim_amount,
    SUM(b.allowed_amount) AS total_allowed_amount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.encounter_id) AS total_encounters,
    ROUND(AVG(b.allowed_amount), 2) AS avg_allowed_per_encounter
FROM billing b
JOIN encounters e ON b.encounter_id = e.encounter_id
JOIN providers p ON e.provider_id = p.provider_id
JOIN specialties s ON p.specialty_id = s.specialty_id
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(e.encounter_date, '%Y-%m'), s.specialty_id, s.specialty_name
ORDER BY month, total_allowed_amount DESC;

Schema Analysis:
---------------
Tables joined: billing, encounters, providers, specialties  
Number of joins: 3
Join chain: billing → encounters → providers → specialties
Aggregation: SUM(), COUNT(DISTINCT), AVG() with GROUP BY

Performance:
-----------
Execution time: ~1.8 seconds (estimated)
Estimated rows scanned:
- billing table: ~8,000 rows
- encounters table: lookup per billing record
- providers table: lookup per encounter  
- specialties table: lookup per provider
Total rows processed: ~25,000+

Bottleneck Identified:
---------------------
1. Long JOIN chain creates dependency bottleneck
2. GROUP BY on computed DATE_FORMAT() prevents index usage  
3. Multiple aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT DISTINCT, AVG) 
4. No covering indexes for the join columns
5. Billing table lacks proper indexing on encounter_id
6. Computed grouping column requires full table processing

Root Cause: Multi-table join chain with expensive aggregations and computed grouping


=============================================================
OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
=============================================================

Common Performance Issues Identified:
1. **Multiple JOIN Chains**: All queries require 2-4 table joins
2. **Missing Indexes**: No proper indexes for join columns and date ranges  
3. **Computed GROUP BY**: DATE_FORMAT() prevents index usage
4. **Row Explosion**: Many-to-many relationships create large intermediate results
5. **Self-Joins**: Temporal queries require expensive self-join operations
6. **Complex Aggregations**: COUNT(DISTINCT), multiple aggregation functions

Expected Performance with Sample Data:
- Query 1: 1.2 seconds (2-table joins + aggregation)
- Query 2: 2.8 seconds (4-table joins + row explosion) 
- Query 3: 3.5 seconds (self-join + temporal analysis)
- Query 4: 1.8 seconds (3-table join chain + aggregation)

Why Star Schema Will Be Faster:
1. **Fewer Joins**: Direct dimension lookups vs. join chains
2. **Pre-aggregated Metrics**: Avoid real-time calculations
3. **Denormalization**: Reduce number of tables to join
4. **Better Indexing**: Optimized for analytical queries
5. **Date Dimension**: Pre-computed date attributes
